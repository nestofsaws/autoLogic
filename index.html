	<p>At<strong> Auto Logic</strong>, our <strong><em>ASE</em></strong> 
certified master technicians are paid a salary. Service advisors are 
also <strong><em>ASE</em></strong>  certified technicians and they too 
are paid a salary.&nbsp; Since we opened the door in 1985 this is the 
way we have done it. Our self evaluation isn't done by looking at the 
bottom line of a profit and loss statement, but is centered on the 
relationship we have with our customers. That relationship is built 
on uncompromising honesty, technical excellence, and kept promises. 
Here are some of the promises we make to you:
</p>

<ul>
<li>No surprises! You will get an estimate. It will be accurate.&nbsp; </li>

<li>Trust! We will earn it. We will continually prove we are worthy of it. </li>


<li>Technical excellence! Knowledge and skill properly applied. No bozos,
no beating on cars with the wrong tools, no bad ideas poorly applied to shorten 
the life of your automobile and drive the cost up. Proper diagnosis, proper repair.</li>

<li>We will care!! Just like you are a member of the family. We will take time
 to talk to you, explain your automobile and what it needs, and listen to what you 
 are concerned about. </li>

<li>Honesty and Integrity! Our advice will be built on your needs not ours. We will 
never embrace a business model of maximum profit for minimum effort. </li>
</ul>
<p>And that means, very simply, that you find your automobile to be as safe, 
reliable, lasting, and economical as is possible. </p>
<p>We know that if we do all these things well and consistently the profits
will be a logical consequence. Since 1986 this philosophy has been applied 
to make Auto Logic consistently the most respected and acclaimed full service 
repair facility in the triangle. </p>

		<!--<p><strong>First, the ugly TRUTH<br>
			What you don't know can cost you!</strong><br>
			
			<p>Automotive repair centers are stressful fast paced businesses. 
			Every second is counted and pressured to pay for itself, to make profit. 
			Technicians are paid on a commission basis as an inducement to work as 
			fast as possible. It improves paychecks to <strong><em>ignore difficult
			 problems</em></strong> and sell the most profitable repairs. They call
			  it picking &quot;cherries&quot;. Service advisors have been to sales 
			  school, but seldom know much more about your car than this. 
			  <strong><em>If they don't sell you lots of repairs, they won't get
			   much of a paycheck.</em></strong>That's the industry standard. It 
			   happens in most shops even as the commercials run touting how you 
			   aren't going to pay a lot for that muffler or that Mr. &quot;NiceWrench&quot; 
			   is really looking out for you and yours. <strong><em>New &quot;repairs&quot; 
			   are invented just to produce profit centers.</em></strong> Transmission 
			   flushes, engine flushes, fuel injector cleaning. Expensive procedures 
			   that all have in common that they are usually applied to cars that are 
			   operating normally. <strong><em>Look in your owners manual.</em></strong> 
			   See how often you are cautioned to get these &quot;important highly 
			   effective preventive procedures.&quot; Hmm, still looking?<br>
			Who is looking out for you? The whole structure of the business
			 informs you that you <em>are</em> going to pay too much for the
			  muffler and that Mr. GreedyTools has his eye firmly on how much 
			  money he can take from your pocket and put in his. This is way it has
			   been done since the first Model T came off the line.
